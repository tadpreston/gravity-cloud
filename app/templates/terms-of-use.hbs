Access to and use of the Service is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, and your use of the Service signifies and constitutes your acceptance of this Agreement. If you do not agree to this Agreement, you should not use the Service. Provider may revise this Agreement from time to time. Although Provider may include a notice on the home page of the Service that the Agreement has been modified, such notice may not remain in place for any extended period of time. Accordingly, you should review the Agreement as posted on the Service from time to time. Using the Service after any revised Agreement has been posted will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
      <p>Your entry into this Agreement shall not affect any written agreements between you and Provider, all of which shall remain in full force and effect according to their terms. With respect to your use of the Service, any written agreement between you and Provider regarding the Service shall govern in the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and such written agreement.</p>
    <h2>1. Purpose of the Service</h2>
      <p>The Service provides a number of different features, products, and services to assist you in creating and maintaining an inventory of records, including information regarding individuals, business assets, personal property, insurance policies and warranties. The service is not intended to provide legal, tax or financial advice. NEITHER PROVIDER NOR THE SERVICE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE LEGAL, TAX OR FINANCIAL ADVICE. PROVIDER IS NOT A FINANCIAL PLANNER, BROKER OR TAX ADVISOR AND DOES NOT OFFER PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OR POSSESSION OF RECORDS. The Service is intended only to assist you in maintaining inventories of records and is broad in scope. Your personal situation is unique, and any information and advice obtained through the Service may not be appropriate for your situation. Accordingly, before making any final decisions or implementing any record management, insurance, or financial strategy, you should consider obtaining advice from your accountant or other financial advisers who are fully aware of your individual circumstances. You acknowledge that Provider disclaims any responsibility for or liability related to your use of the Service (see “Disclaimer of Warranties” below).</p>
    <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
      <p>Use of the Service may be available through a compatible Internet browser or mobile device and may require network connections and software. You agree that you are solely responsible for these requirements, including any applicable changes, updates and fees as well as the terms of your agreement with your mobile device and telecommunications provider. Your right to access and use the Service is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity. You are only entitled to access and use the Service for lawful purposes. Accurate records enable Provider to provide the Service to you.

    <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>To post information to and otherwise use the Service, you must first register by creating a User Account. User Account registration requires you to submit to Provider certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number, and other information.&nbsp; If you choose to set up your User Account to electronically pay for certain fee-based Services, you will also be required to provide a valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner).&nbsp; You grant Provider the right to provide any information you submit to Provider to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of any transactions initiated by you or on your behalf.&nbsp; You understand that your continued use of the Services following any trial period may result in charges to you for the Services (“Charges”).&nbsp; Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law.&nbsp;&nbsp;Charges are based on Services purchased and not actual usage and fees paid are non-refundable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provider reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise the&nbsp;Charges&nbsp;to you for the Services&nbsp;for all or part of the Services at any time in Provider’s sole discretion.&nbsp; Provider will use reasonable efforts to inform you of such Charges and You may elect to cancel the Services rather than pay the Charges.&nbsp; You understand that your continued use of the Services following notice from Provider may result in charges to you for the Services and that Provider may terminate or suspend the Services until you have paid the Charges.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access your User Account, and it is recommended that you choose a strong password, i.e., a password of sufficient length and complexity such that third parties will not readily guess your password. You should take measures to maintain and preserve the confidentiality of the username and password associated with your User Account, and you must notify Provider promptly of any unauthorized use or suspected breach of security of your User Account. Provider shall not be liable for any losses that may result from any unauthorized use of your User Account or failure to maintain appropriate confidentiality measures. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your User Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. Provider owns your User Account credentials and may revoke or change them at any time.</p>

      <p>By using the Service, you may choose to submit information, data, passwords, usernames, PINs, other log-in information, as well as information regarding records, photographs, and other materials and content relating thereto (collectively, the “User Content”). You expressly agree that you shall not post any User Content: (i) that infringes or misappropriates any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (ii) that violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including, but not limited to, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising); (iii) that is or may reasonably be considered to be defamatory, libelous, hateful, racially or religiously biased or offensive, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing to any individual, partnership or corporation; pornographic or obscene (iv) that contains individually identifiable health information subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule; (v) that violates any other agreement you may have entered into with a third party; or (vi) that contains any computer viruses, worms or other potentially damaging computer programs or files.</p>

Provider may use and store the User Content, but only to provide the Service to you. By submitting this User Content to Provider, you represent that you are entitled to submit it to Provider for use for this purpose, without any obligation by Provider to pay any fees or other limitations.</p>
    <h2>7. Access to Third Party Accounts</h2>
      <p>If you choose to use or access third party websites and/or accounts through the Service, such as eBay®, Amazon.com®, Facebook®, and Twitter®, you will be directly connected to the website for the third party you have identified. By using the Service in this manner, you expressly authorize Provider to access your account information maintained by such third parties, on your behalf as your agent.

You hereby authorize and permit Provider to disclose, use and store information submitted by you to the Service (such as account passwords and user names) to accomplish the foregoing and to configure the Service so that it is compatible with the third party sites to which you submit your information. For purposes of this Agreement and solely to provide the account information to you as part of the Service, you grant Provider a limited power of attorney, and appoint Provider as your attorney-in-fact and agent, to access third party sites, retrieve and use your information with the full power and authority to do and perform each thing necessary in connection with such activities, as you could do in person. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN PROVIDER IS ACCESSING AND RETRIEVING ACCOUNT INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY SITES, PROVIDER IS ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT AS THE AGENT OF OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY.
